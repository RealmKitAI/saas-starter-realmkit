## Module Structure
Each module follows this structure:
1. **Overview** - High-level description of the feature
2. **Key Files** - Important files and their locations
3. **Common Tasks** - Step-by-step guides for frequent operations
4. **Patterns** - Feature-specific patterns and conventions
5. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

## Best Practices for AI Assistants
1. Always load 00-CORE.md first
2. Load only necessary feature modules
3. Check module overview before diving into details
4. Follow established patterns from the modules
5. Refer to examples in the modules
6. Update modules when adding new patterns

## Creating New Modules
When adding new features that warrant their own module:
1. Create `XX-FEATURE.md` with next number
2. Follow the existing module structure
3. Document key files and patterns
4. Add common task examples
5. Update this README

## Module Dependencies
Some modules depend on others:
- PAYMENTS depends on AUTH (user must be authenticated)
- ADMIN depends on AUTH (role-based access)
- EMAIL is standalone but often used with AUTH

Load dependent modules together for complete context.
